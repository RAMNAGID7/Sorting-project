This Java program, represented by the `hw5` class, contains several search and sorting algorithms implemented in methods. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

### Search Algorithms:
1. **Linear Search (`linearSearch`):**
   - Searches for a given string (`word`) in an array of strings (`s`).
   - Prints the amount of unsuccessful comparisons made.

2. **Jump Search (`jumpSearch`):**
   - Searches for a given integer (`n`) in an array of integers (`numbers`).
   - Uses the jump search algorithm and calls `linearSearch2` for detailed searching within blocks.
   - Prints the amount of unsuccessful comparisons made.

3. **Ternary Search (`ternarySearch`):**
   - Searches for a given integer (`key`) in a sorted array of integers (`ar`) using the ternary search algorithm.
   - Returns the index of the key or -1 if not found.

4. **Interpolation Search (`interpolationSearch`):**
   - Searches for a given character (`key`) in a sorted array of characters (`arr`) using the interpolation search algorithm.
   - Returns the index of the key or -1 if not found.
   - Prints the amount of unsuccessful equalizations made.

### Sorting Algorithms:
1. **Insertion Sort (`insertionSort`):**
   - Sorts an array of integers (`numbers`) using the insertion sort algorithm.
   - Prints the amount of exchanges made between elements in the array.

2. **Bubble Sort (`bubbleSort`):**
   - Sorts an array of integers (`numbers`) using the bubble sort algorithm.
   - Prints the amount of exchanges made between elements in the array.

### Main Method:
- Invokes each search and sorting method with sample data for testing.
- Demonstrates the usage of the implemented algorithms.

It's worth noting that the `linearSearch2` method seems to be an internal helper method for the jump search algorithm, facilitating detailed searching within blocks. The program is well-commented, making it easier to understand the functionality of each method.
